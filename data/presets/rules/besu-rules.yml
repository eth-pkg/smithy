  # =============================================
  # Besu Security Configuration Rules
  # =============================================
  # Enforces strict security rules for Besu's allowlist configuration:
  # - Prevents mixing wildcards (*) or 'all' with specific hosts
  # - This prevents accidental exposure by ensuring the allowlist is either:
  #   * Completely open (just '*' or 'all')
  #   * Completely closed (specific hosts only)
  # - Prevents ambiguous configurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities
